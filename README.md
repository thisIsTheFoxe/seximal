### inspired by [a better way to count - jan Misali](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qID2B4MK7Y0)

__Seximal__ (also [Senary or Heximal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senary)) is a numbering system that uses the number six (10, DEC6, b0110, 0x06) as its base.

The goal of this app is to introduce and educate people about a new way of counting and it's advantages. It gives a glimpse into a ~~decimal~~ seximal world. 
I hope this app will help people think about our current decimal system and make them question it and not let them think of it as granted as we most often do.
I do not hope to revolutionize decimalism, which frankly is quite impossible. But if this app makes you pause for just a moment and makes you reason 
about mathematics and why seximal might be a better or worse system than decimal or what our world would look like if humans didn't have 14 fingers,
then this app fullfilled it's purpose. 

Feel free to contibute ideas or improvements or to take my work and use it in some other way to educate and amaze people.
